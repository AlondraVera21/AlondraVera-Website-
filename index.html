        <p class="lead mb-4">Im currenlty a second year at the University Of California, Riverside.  <br><br>

       I'm currently a second year studying Sociology. I plan to switch majors next year to Computer Science, because I thoroughly enjoy it. My main goals are to do something with Sociology and Computer Science. I enjoy the ‚Äúsociety‚Äù part of learning Sociology. The way our society contributes to our many life experiences is intriguing. And I've always had a spot for Computer Science because I love the idea of being able to program something and see the end results. The way that everything that involves technology requires a source of code and algorithm is what makes me so interested in it. Computer science has to be my favorite thing that I enjoy learning more about even when I'm not majoring in it. The best thing is that because I'm in my second year I have a little more time to think about where I want to take my career. And if sociology is not my interest then I can always end up switching it. 
For sociology, I developed a new perspective in life for societies and how they all connect to our struggles and successes. A few things about me is I want to get more involved in clubs at my university. I plan on doing work study next quarter and seeing how I'm able to manage both a job and school. In my free time I enjoy going for a drive or hanging out with friends. For my future career goal I want to become a software engineer or do something with Computer Science. Or become a Social Worker for kids in Juvenile Detention. Although I still have a lot of time to think, those are just some ideas of what I would like to do in the near future. I think my major is good for right now but this is not the only thing I'd like to learn while I am in college. I think that is the good thing about college is you have a lot of freedom to take whatever classes that interest you. 
My experience at the University Of California, Riverside has been good so far. I want to be more involved with the school and the resources they offer. I'm currently in my second year and it's not as bad as I thought it would be. Dorming allows me to create my own community that surrounds me.I think being able to get a job as I work in school would be beneficial. Work study allows me to have a flexible schedule. And also you end up getting a lot of experience and you might not have had it without having a job. My major is flexible enough to try and add in more units as well that can help me finish college faster. Overall, I wanted to do this resume in order to show my strong skills like organization, communication, and flexibility. Those are some that are very important to me in order to work effectively in a job. I think students who work while in school also gain time management skills that can be beneficial in the long run.
